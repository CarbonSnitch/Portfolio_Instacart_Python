## Context
Instacart's assumptions are that their customers do not differ in different regions, they can market to all customers equally with same outcome. Data analysis should inform these assumptions.

## Task included analyzing data from Instacart to determine more information about sales patterns.

- Initial data importing and concantanation in Python
- Basic desciptive and exploratory tasks
- Data consistency checks, missing values checks, duplicate checks
- Inserting new flags for more detailed data anlysis
- Final data explorations, analysis, graph creating and exporting for presentation

  ## Key Questions to be answered
  [Final Report](05 Sent to Client/A4_final_report_RGN.xlsx)

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
-  Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
-  The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
  -  For example:
    - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
    - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
    - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
    - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
    - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
    - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering,   and anything else you can think of.
